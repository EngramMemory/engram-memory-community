# Generic MCP client

**Engram works with any MCP-compatible client via the Engram MCP
server at [`mcp/server.py`](../../mcp/server.py).** This page is
for agents not explicitly called out in the other integration
docs — anything that speaks the Model Context Protocol over stdio
and can spawn a Python subprocess.

The MCP server exposes seven tools that run against the local
recall engine (Qdrant + FastEmbed + hash index). The push path
runs alongside it as the `engram-bridge` CLI + git hook + pytest
plugin, exactly as it does for every other agent.

---

## Prerequisites

- Engram cloud API key starting with `eng_live_`
  (grab one at [https://engrammemory.ai](https://engrammemory.ai))
- Bridge installed:
  ```bash
  cd engram-memory-community
  pip install -e ./bridge
  ```
- `~/.engram/config.yaml` with a valid `api_key`:
  ```bash
  engram-bridge install --write-config-template
  $EDITOR ~/.engram/config.yaml
  engram-bridge status
  ```
- Python 3.10+ and the `mcp` Python package
  (`pip install mcp`).
- A running local recall engine — either the all-in-one
  `engrammemory/engram-memory` Docker container, or Qdrant at
  `localhost:6333` + FastEmbed at `localhost:11435` configured
  from your own compose file.

Full bridge install and config walkthrough lives in
**[../../bridge/README.md](../../bridge/README.md)**.

## Wiring the read path

Every MCP client has its own config file, but the server entry
always looks the same. Tell your client to launch Python with
`mcp/server.py` as the script and stdio as the transport:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "engrammemory": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "/absolute/path/to/engram-memory-community/mcp/server.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "QDRANT_URL": "http://localhost:6333",
        "FASTEMBED_URL": "http://localhost:11435",
        "COLLECTION_NAME": "agent-memory",
        "ENGRAM_API_KEY": "eng_live_...",
        "ENGRAM_API_URL": "https://api.engrammemory.ai"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Some clients nest the server under a different key
(`experimental.modelContextProtocolServers` for Continue,
`transport: { type: "stdio" }` wrappers for others) — check your
client's docs for the exact schema. The **three fields that
matter** are always:

1. `command` → `python`
2. `args` → the absolute path to `mcp/server.py`
3. `env` → `QDRANT_URL`, `FASTEMBED_URL`, `COLLECTION_NAME`, and
   optionally `ENGRAM_API_KEY` / `ENGRAM_API_URL` if your agent
   needs the cloud-backed variants.

### Tools advertised by the server

Once the server is connected, the client sees seven tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `memory_store` | Store a memory with `text`, `category` (`preference` / `fact` / `decision` / `entity` / `other`), and `importance` (0-1) |
| `memory_search` | Three-tier search (hot cache → hash → vector) for a free-form `query`, optional `limit` and `category` filter |
| `memory_recall` | Same as search, tuned for context injection — use this on turn 1 for "what do you know about this task" |
| `memory_forget` | Delete by `memory_id` (UUID) or by `query` (deletes the best match) |
| `memory_consolidate` | Janitor: merge near-duplicate memories at a fixed 0.95 similarity threshold (Community tier) |
| `memory_feedback` | Tell Engram which search results were useful — improves future recall ranking at zero cost |
| `memory_connect` | Discover cross-category links for a memory; capped at 3 connections per call on the Community tier |

The full JSON schema for every tool is at the top of
[`mcp/server.py`](../../mcp/server.py) in the `_register_tools`
method (look for the `Tool(...)` entries).

### Important: MCP doesn't do "session start"

Unlike Claude Code's `SessionStart` hook, MCP tools are called
**on demand** by the agent — only when the model decides to use
them. That means the read path is opt-in per message. You get
"pull context at the start of every new chat" behavior by:

1. Writing a system-prompt rule for your client that tells the
   agent to call `memory_recall` on turn 1, or
2. Wrapping your agent's launcher in a shell alias that runs
   `engram-bridge pull` and stuffs the output into a scratch
   file (`.engram-context.md`) that your system prompt references,
   or
3. Accepting that "search memory" is a verb the user (or a
   higher-level orchestrator) invokes explicitly, the way they'd
   invoke any other tool.

For most MCP clients the rule approach is the least invasive.

## Wiring the push path

The push path is agent-agnostic — it runs alongside, not inside,
your MCP client. Every push helper is the same `engram-bridge`
CLI that every other integration uses.

### 1. Manual milestone push

```bash
engram-bridge push "chose duckdb over sqlite for the report layer"
engram-bridge push "user wants all JSON columns typed, never raw" \
    --type preference
```

### 2. Git post-commit hook

```bash
cd ~/code/my-repo
engram-bridge install --git-hooks
```

Writes `.git/hooks/post-commit` with a one-line
`engram-bridge push-commit` call. Idempotent; safe on repos with
existing hooks.

### 3. pytest plugin

Auto-loads via `pytest11` entry point after `pip install -e ./bridge`.
Every green pytest session pushes a `test_pass` event.

### 4. Shell wrappers for jest / cargo / go

```sh
engram_go_test() {
  local start end status
  start=$(date +%s)
  go test "$@"
  status=$?
  end=$(date +%s)
  if [ "$status" -eq 0 ]; then
    engram-bridge push-test "$(basename "$PWD")" \
        "$((end - start))" "0" --runner go >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
  fi
  return "$status"
}
alias gotest=engram_go_test
```

Change `go`/`go` for `npm`/`jest` or `cargo`/`cargo` as needed —
all four are valid `--runner` values.

## Wiring team sharing (Wave 3)

```bash
engram-bridge team list
engram-bridge team create "my-team" --slug my-team
engram-bridge team add-member <team_uuid> <user_uuid> --role member
engram-bridge push "shipped feature X" --team <team_uuid>
engram-bridge pull --scope team:<team_uuid>
```

> **Gap:** the MCP server advertises `memory_store`,
> `memory_search`, and `memory_recall` without a `scope` or
> `team_id` argument. Team reads and writes have to go through
> the bridge CLI (`engram-bridge push --team ...`, `pull --scope
> team:...`) until a later wave adds scope to the MCP tool
> schemas. The server does not error on team calls — it simply
> has no team code path, so every tool call today hits the
> per-user personal collection.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Config file exists?**
   `test -f ~/.engram/config.yaml && echo ok || echo missing`
2. **`api_key` set?** Must start with `eng_live_`.
3. **`enabled: true`** in `~/.engram/config.yaml`?
4. **`engram-bridge status`** says `api health: ok`?
5. **Bridge log clean?** `tail -50 ~/.engram/bridge.log`

MCP-specific checks:

- If your client can't connect to `engrammemory`, run the server
  by hand to see its startup log:
  ```bash
  python /path/to/engram-memory-community/mcp/server.py
  ```
  You should see lines like `Engram MCP Server initialized`,
  `Qdrant: http://localhost:6333`, and `Recall engine warmed up`.
  If you see `Warning: Recall engine not available`, the local
  `src/recall/` package isn't importable — install the repo in
  editable mode (`pip install -e ./bridge`) from the repo root.
- If you see `Error: mcp package not found`, run
  `pip install mcp` into the Python interpreter your client
  spawns. Use an absolute path to a venv Python in `command` if
  your system Python isn't the one with `mcp` installed.
- Clients that auto-restart MCP servers on config change can
  leak orphan processes. If `ps aux | grep mcp/server.py` shows
  more than one copy, kill them and reload the client cleanly.
