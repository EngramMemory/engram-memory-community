"""Minimal reranking feedback loop.

Simulates what a real agent loop does: search, let a (stub) judgment
function decide which hits are useful, then call /v1/feedback so the
cloud can boost good ids and penalize bad ones on future queries.

In production the judgment step is your own model — a cheap LLM
rerank, a rule-based classifier, or just the final state of your
context buffer. The key idea is that *any* signal you already
compute is useful to the cloud, so feedback should be cheap to wire
up everywhere search is called.
