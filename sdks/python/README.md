# engram-py

Official Python SDK for the **[Engram](https://engrammemory.ai)** cloud memory API.

A thin, dependency-light client (`httpx` only) for storing and recalling
memories, managing team-shared collections, and feeding reranking
signals back to the engine. Ships both a blocking `EngramClient` and
an `AsyncEngramClient` so you can drop it into scripts, background
workers, or FastAPI handlers without a second SDK.

## Install

```bash
pip install engram-py
```

Or install the in-repo copy for local development:

```bash
pip install -e ./sdks/python
```

The only runtime dependency is `httpx>=0.25`. Python 3.9+ supported.

## Authentication

Every call needs a cloud API key. Grab one from the dashboard at
[engrammemory.ai](https://engrammemory.ai) and pass it to the client
constructor, or export it and let the SDK pick it up automatically:

```bash
export ENGRAM_API_KEY=pr_live_...
```

```python
from engram import EngramClient

client = EngramClient()                # reads ENGRAM_API_KEY
# or
client = EngramClient(api_key="pr_live_...")
```

## Quickstart

Store a memory, search for it, feed the result back:

```python
from engram import EngramClient

client = EngramClient()

client.store(
    "Production Postgres runs on port 5433 with pgvector 0.7.0",
    category="infra",
    importance=0.9,
)

hits = client.search("what port does prod postgres use")
for result in hits.results:
    print(f"{result.score:.2f}  {result.text}")
```

## Team sharing (Wave 3)

Create a team, store a memory into it, then search within the team
scope. Every team operation is authorized server-side by membership —
an unauthorized scope raises `EngramAPIError` with status 403 and no
partial write.

```python
from engram import EngramClient

client = EngramClient()

team = client.create_team(name="Platform Ops", slug="platform-ops")
client.add_team_member(team.id, user_id="<other_user_uuid>", role="member")

# Personal + team fanout in a single store.
client.store(
    "We switched the primary queue to SQS FIFO last quarter",
    category="decisions",
    share_with=[f"team:{team.id}"],
)

# Search the team collection instead of your personal one.
hits = client.search(
    "what messaging system do we use",
    scope=f"team:{team.id}",
)
```

## Feedback loop

After your model picks which memories to actually keep in context,
tell the cloud so it can reinforce the useful ones and penalize the
noise. Zero LLM cost — the judgment comes from your existing pass.

```python
from engram import EngramClient

client = EngramClient()

query = "who owns the billing service"
hits = client.search(query, top_k=10)

# Your model reads all 10 and decides which 2 it keeps.
selected = [hits.results[0].id, hits.results[1].id]
rejected = [h.id for h in hits.results[2:]]

client.feedback(query=query, selected_ids=selected, rejected_ids=rejected)
```

## Error handling

All SDK errors inherit from `EngramError`, so you can catch everything
with a single handler if you want to. More specific subclasses exist
for the cases worth branching on.

```python
from engram import (
    EngramClient,
    EngramError,
    EngramAuthError,
    EngramRateLimitError,
    EngramAPIError,
    EngramConnectionError,
)

client = EngramClient()

try:
    client.search("ping")
except EngramAuthError:
    # 401 — bad / revoked key. Surface to a human.
    raise
except EngramRateLimitError as exc:
    # 429 — sleep exc.retry_after seconds if the server gave us one.
    sleep_for = exc.retry_after or 5.0
    ...
except EngramAPIError as exc:
    # Other 4xx or 5xx after retries are exhausted.
    print(f"API error {exc.status_code}: {exc.message}")
except EngramConnectionError as exc:
    # Network trouble — cause chains to the original httpx error.
    print(f"Connection failed: {exc.__cause__}")
except EngramError:
    raise
```

The SDK automatically retries 5xx responses and transient network
errors with exponential backoff (up to `max_retries`, default 3). 401
and non-429 4xx are never retried.

## Async

Everything above works the same with `AsyncEngramClient`:

```python
import asyncio
from engram import AsyncEngramClient

async def main():
    async with AsyncEngramClient() as client:
        await client.store("I prefer tabs over spaces", category="opinions")
        hits = await client.search("what does eddy prefer for indentation")
        for hit in hits.results:
            print(hit.text)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Configuration

```python
EngramClient(
    api_key=None,                              # or ENGRAM_API_KEY
    base_url="https://api.engrammemory.ai",    # override for self-hosted
    timeout=30.0,                              # seconds
    max_retries=3,                             # retries after first attempt
    retry_backoff=0.5,                         # base seconds for expo backoff
)
```
